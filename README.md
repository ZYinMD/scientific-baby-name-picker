# Scientific Baby Name Picker

## Description
The application allows the user to search for baby names based on data from the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA). The motivation for this project arose from the necessity to filter baby names beyond just the popularity (or lack thereof) of a name. This app allows for exclusions such as elimination of the 70% less popular names during specific periods.

## Key Features
The use of complex filters not found in most baby name search apps. For instance, a user can exclude names that are trending in the past 5 or 10 years.
