# Scientific Baby Name Picker

This is an app that lets users create custom filters to explore the SSA's data of all given names used by all people in the US between 1880-2017.

The goal is to provide a statistical tool to assist parents in picking a baby name.

You may find it was done before I knew React, webpack, Sass.
